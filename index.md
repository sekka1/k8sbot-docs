# What is k8sbot?
{: .fs-9 }
k8sBot makes Kubernetes easier to use. It’s a Slack app that provides Kubectl-like information with an easy-to-use user interface. 
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Now, you can point and click to retrieve pod status, get pod logs, and get troubleshooting recommendations. Our agent runs in your k8s cluster to gather all the relevant information and delivers it to you right in Slack. 


# Why k8sBot?
We’ve heard that Kubernetes is really complex. We want to help teams integrate DevOps principles faster and help every team member quickly get up to speed on the most common Kubernetes commands. We’re not a replacement for kubectl - we are an enhancement. Think of us as the automatic transmission for your Kubernetes engine.
