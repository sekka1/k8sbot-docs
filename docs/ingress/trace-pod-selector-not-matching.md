# Trace - Pod selector not matching
There can be many things wrong with an ingress and why it does not work.  One
problem can be that the `service` label selecting the `pod` is incorrect or is not
able to find any pod(s) with those labels current.  This means that there are no
endpoints for this service which means the `service` will not be able to route
traffic to any destination.

# How k8sbot can help
By asking k8sbot to trace out an `ingress` it will follow all of the mappings and
let you know if it finds anything wrong.

## Command:
```
@k8sbot trace ingress <ingress name>
```

## Response:
```
Ingress

Recommendations:
```
* There are no endpoints/pods associated with the service.  This means that there are no pods to route the ingress to.
* The service selector label(s) could be incorrect.
* There could be no pods with this service selector label(s) running.
```
