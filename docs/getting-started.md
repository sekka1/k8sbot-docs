# Getting Started
We have big plans for what k8sBot will do in the future and are continually building on it. For now, here is a complete list of the specific questions that  k8sBot can help you answer and the recommendations it can identify. Please send new feature ideas to us at info@managedkube.com

1. Why is a pod pending?
   * Not enough CPU, memory, or both
   * No registry secret for a private image
   * Unable to pull private image
   * In a CrashLoopBackOff state
   * Why a pod might be in an Evicted state
2. Why is my ingress not working?
   * Service port not matching pod port
   * Incorrect service label selected
   * No pod endpoints available to send traffic to
3. Why jobs are failing?
   * Look into the job states
5. Logs
   * Easily get log outputs into Slack


## Please send us any feedback that you have via telling k8sbot:
```@k8sbot feedback <your feedback here>```

Don't forget to include your contact information and contextual information about your feedback (we do not keep any information from the bot).
