# Getting Started
We have big plans for what k8sBot will do in the future and are continually building on it. For now, here is a complete list of the specific questions that  k8sBot can help you answer and the recommendations it can discover. Please send new feature ideas to us at info@managedkube.com

1) Why is a pod pending?
   *Not enough CPU, memory, or both
   *No registry secret for a private image
   *Unable to pull private image
2) Why is my ingress not working?
   *Service port not matching pod port
   *Incorrect service label selected
